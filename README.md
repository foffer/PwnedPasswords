## Requirements
> `Swift 4.0`

## Important
This library never sends the password over the network nor does it store the passwords processed. You can read about how it works [here](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/#cloudflareprivacyandkanonymity)

## Installation

PwnedPasswords is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PwnedPasswords'
```
or

```swift
  .package(url: "https://github.com/foffer/PwnedPasswords.git", .branch("master"))
```
or

copy the `PwnedPasswords.swift` and `ApiClient.swift` into your project.

## Usage
```
class ViewController: UIViewController {

  @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!

  @IBAction func buttonDidPress(_ sender: Any) {
    guard let text = textField.text else { return }
    let client = PwnedPasswords()

    client.check(text) { occurences, error in
      guard error == nil else {
        print(error)
        return
      }
      
      if let occurences = occurences {
        if occurences > 0 {
          print("ðŸ›‘ The password you entered has been in a breach")
        } else {
          print("âœ… The password you entered was not found")
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```
